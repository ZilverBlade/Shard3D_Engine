# IMPORTANT NOTICE
### Shard3D has moved over to GitLabs! This is due to storage issues and bandwith from the libraries included (especially .lib), and github not wanting to accept my student benefits request for whatever reason
## [You can find my repository here now!](https://gitlab.com/ZilverBlade/Shard3D_Engine)

# What Shard3D offers

### Scripting

Shard3D supports scripting in both C# and Visual Basic, and you may use them interchangeably.
C++ Native scripting is also available, but does not have the same flexibility as previously mentioned languages, and must be hard-coded in the project.
